Isaac Newton defined the laws of motion and gravity, which were later expanded upon by Albert Einstein through his deeper understanding of time and gravity.
However, Einstein himself was not fully satisfied with his theory.
He believed that the theory of relativity offered only a limited perspective, aimed at improving measurement and relative observation, and that it still left certain aspects of time and gravity unexplained.
This paper discuss narrower view of the cause for time, inertia and gravity based on newton, Einstein and multiple experiment results.
The question 'of why' for time, inertia and gravity will be discussed
